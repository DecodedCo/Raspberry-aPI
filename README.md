This repo runs our Raspberry Pi from our London HQ.

It uses Node.js as the server framework, and is written in JavaScript. 

Run the server by cloning this repo onto your own server, installing node and node package manager (npm), and then run `node server.js`

Server.js is the main file, referencing checkins.js and server.js


git update-index --assume-unchanged checkin/default.json
